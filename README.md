This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (with the TypeScript template)

## Available Scripts

To run this project locally you need Node and NPM installed. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the necessary dependencies, and make a HUGE folder on your computer called node_modules. This is required before running `npm start` or `npm run build`. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
